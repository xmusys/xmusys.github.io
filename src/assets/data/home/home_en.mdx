# Welcome to the ERAS Research Group!

*Efficient, Reliable, and Advanced Storage Research Group*

Our research group, led by Prof. Zhirong Shen, primarily focuses on intelligent storage technologies. Specifically, our research interests includes reliable and efficient storage based on erasure codes, fault tolerance and performance optimization for emerging memory devices, as well as KV storage systems.

In the past three years, our group has published over ten papers in international conferences and authoritative journals, including USENIX ATC, HPCA, INFOCOM, and IEEE TC. Additionally, we have received support from national grants, such as the Natural Science Foundation of China, and have established collaborations with renowned companies like Alibaba and Huawei.
