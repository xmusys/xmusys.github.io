# Welcome to the ZhiRong Research Group!

Our group is led by Prof. Jiwu Shu and Prof. Youyou Lu. We aim at building efficient and reliable storage system software with emerging devices (e.g., non-volatile memories, open-channel SSDs, programmable NICs/switches).

We are one of the first teams in China to start working on storage systems. Our group has produced around a hundred publications on international conferences including OSDI, SOSP, FAST, MICRO, SC etc. as well as authoritative journals like ACM TOS etc.
